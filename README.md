# FlipPy: Probablistic programming in Python

FlipPy is Python library for specifying probabilistic programs.
It prioritizes compatibility with Python, universality,
and maintainability.
It takes inspiration from the design and implementation
of [WebPPL](https://dippl.org/).

## Getting started

FlipPy can be installed from PyPi:
```
$ pip install flippy-lang
```

## Tests

To run the tests (this requires installing pytest):
```
(venv) $ pytest
```
